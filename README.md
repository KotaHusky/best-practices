# Best Practices Repository

## Introduction
Welcome! This repository is dedicated to housing Agile Engineering Best Practices documentation, guides, and related resources. The goal is to empower new and existing software development teams with documentation on best coding practices, project management methodologies, and CI/CD processes.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this repository is to:
- **Consolidate Knowledge**: Serve as a hub for best practices, coding standards, and guidelines that development teams should follow.
- **Promote Consistency**: Ensure consistent application of coding standards, commit conventions, and CI/CD processes across projects.
- **Facilitate Onboarding**: Provide an easily accessible resource for new developers to get up to speed with best practices.
- **Technology Agnostic with Opinionated Standards**: While the documentation strives to be agnostic of tech stacks where possible, it may carry opinions or biases towards processes or standards that have proven effective. Specifically, these insights draw from successful implementations in Scrum at Scale, and environments utilizing TypeScript, Python, Shell, and PowerShell. This approach ensures the guidance is grounded in practical experience, offering valuable insights for teams working within these or similar technologies.
